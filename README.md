Introduction
Sorting algorithms are fundamental in computer science and play a critical role in various applications. This repository provides clear and concise C++ implementations of three classic sorting algorithms: Insertion Sort, Bubble Sort, and Selection Sort. By studying these implementations, you can deepen your understanding of how these algorithms work and how they compare in terms of time complexity and performance.

Sorting Algorithms
Insertion Sort
Insertion Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one item at a time. It iterates through the input elements, removing one element at a time and inserting it into the correct position in the sorted part of the array.

Bubble Sort
Bubble Sort is a straightforward sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted.

Selection Sort
Selection Sort is an in-place comparison sorting algorithm that divides the input list into two parts: the left sublist, which is sorted, and the right sublist, which is unsorted. The algorithm repeatedly finds the minimum element from the unsorted part and moves it to the end of the sorted part.

Getting Started
To get started with using or contributing to this project, follow these simple steps:

Clone the repository: Use git clone to clone this repository to your local machine.
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/amarjeet2611/Sorting/
Navigate to the project folder: Change directory to the cloned project folder.
